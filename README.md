# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
Summary :
This initiative develops a digit identification system employing deep learning methods. The model is trained using the MNIST dataset, a commonly utilized standard for classifying handwritten digits.

Aims:-

Categorize handwritten numbers ranging from 0 to 9 with great precision.

Utilize Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for effective feature extraction.

Approaches:-

Data preprocessing: Standardizing pixel values and restructuring data.

Model design: Creating a CNN structure for extracting features and classification.

Training: Implementing the training dataset to enhance the CNN.

Assessment: Measuring model effectiveness on untested data.

Essential Elements:-

Dataset: MNIST dataset featuring 60,000 images for training and 10,000 images for testing.

Architecture: A multi-layer CNN comprising convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers.

Assessment Parameters: Accuracy and loss in testing.
